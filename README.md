# Distributedness-of-decision-information
We have evidence from decision-making in a macaque brain that decision information is first distributed over many individual neurons, but is then found localized in single neurons near the time of the decision action (for more details see paper: http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fnins.2017.00313 ).
